I created a new modeling function plot.model.acc() and saved hte old function as plot.model.acc.old().
The original ACC model plotting function was based on Andreas' plot.model() function used for Georgia data.
The new modeling function switches from using R's built in plot() function to the ggplot2 package.
I did this for consistency with the hospitalization functions I created and I like ggplot2 better.
I also added several options to the plotting function so we can customize exactly what we want for the article.

Using plot.model.acc()
Requires having the model object created by evaluate.model()
Also utilizes data pulled from the GA DPH website on actual reported cases in the service area
Arguments
  * data is a model object from evaluate.model()
  * accdata.date is a vector of dates from the GA DPH website pulls
  * accdata.cases is a numeric vector of counts from the GA DPH website pulls (same length as accdata.date)
  * log was an option if set to "y", converts the y-axis to log scale, depricated and happens automatically now
  * title is an option to add a title to the top of the figure, defaults to no title
  * max.y is the maximum value for the y-axis, I set it to 10,000 by default now in the function for consistency across plots
  * meanonly if set to TRUE will only plot the mean line for each model compartment (rather than all lines from all simulations)
  * trim.days will trim from the far end (latest dates of the model projection) the number of days passed to the argument, length of the x-axis defaults to the length of the projection passed through the data argument
  * include.lines defaults to a vector ("L", "Inf", "Iso", "C"), if we choose not to plot one or more of the compartments for the publication figure, a new vector including only the compartments to plot can be passed. Compartments must match those exactly where the 4 listed above are for the Latent, Infectious, Isolated, and cases compartments
  
  
Using plot_hospitalizations()
Requires an object created by the series of functions:
  * model_hospitalizations()
  * summarise_model_hospitalizations()
  * hospital_capacity()
Arguments
  * res_sum is the model object that ultimately comes from hospital_capacity()
  * type is either "capacity" or "cum" where "capacity" corresponds to the estimated number of hospitalizations each day and "cum" corresponds to the cumulative hospitalizations
  * title is an option to add a title to the top of the figure, defaults to not title
  * hosp_file is the path to the PARMC hospitalizations file (or some other file constructed in a similar manner), note that this only includes PARMC hospitalizations, a fairly big limitation to those figures unless we make assumptions about corresponding cases at St. Mary's
